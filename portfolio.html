                My name is Katherine Terve and I am from Fort Lee city. I moved to US when I was in 6th grade and was learning Enlish as a secong language. I really enjoy drawing in my freetime and exploring new places with my friends. 
                <br> I chose the architecture major because I enjoy seeing a defferent variety of austhetic and wonderful bulding which inspired me to eventually create and design my own new building.
